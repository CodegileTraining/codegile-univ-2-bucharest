Start out by reading the code in all the classes.
You have to figure out what it is trying to accomplish, while refactoring wherever it is necessary based on the
coding conventions and structures you have learned this week:
 - Variable naming
 - List declaration & iteration
 - Access modifiers (private / public)
 - Polymorphism
 - Modularity (keeping logic separately in classes / functions)

Once you have understood what the code does and brought it to a more human-readable form, try to refactor on a more
general scale (project/class-level), trying to reach a high level of clean/efficient code.

 Warning! There are bugs in the code! You will have to fix them before you can actually run the app.

You will find a few concepts which you might not be familiar with yet. Use CTRL+Q/Google to learn more about them,
and feel free to ask any questions anytime on our Slack channel.

Happy coding!
